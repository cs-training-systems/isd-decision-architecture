# ISD Decision Architecture
**Project Type:** Computational Ontology & Decision Support Framework
**Phase:** I - Taxonomic Discovery & Primitive Mapping

## Overview
`isd-decision-architecture` is an ongoing research initiative to map the "Decision DNA" of Instructional Systems Design (ISD). This project treats instructional design as a **formal engineering discipline**, decomposing high-level pedagogical theories into atomic decision primitives.

## The Problem Space
Instructional Design often suffers from "Expert Blindness"—where critical design decisions are made based on intuition rather than explicit logic. This project aims to externalize that intuition into a structured, machine-readable architecture.

## Current State: Taxonomic Topography (The 1400-Node Map)
The current primary artifact is a large-scale **Knowledge Graph** (1400+ nodes) capturing the raw dependencies of the ISD lifecycle. 

**Note for Reviewers:**
The visual complexity of the current graph represents the **Discovery Phase**. In systems science, we prioritize *completeness* of the data intake before *pruning* for hierarchy. This "messy" topography is the raw data from which our modular, streamlined frameworks (like the 8-day STSA implementation) are derived.

## Project Methodology: Configuration Audit
We use a **Configuration-Audit** approach to outcome engineering. By mapping the primitives first, we can ensure that every training intervention is:
1.  **Atomic:** Driven by a specific, isolated system constraint.
2.  **Traceable:** Linked back to a validated decision rule (DMN 1.6).
3.  **Measurable:** Validated through Evidence-Centered Design (ECD).

## Learning in Public (Iterative Disclosure)
This repository functions as a **Live-State Technical Lab**. We believe that documenting the "messy" process of ontological discovery is as valuable as the final toolset, as it provides a transparent audit trail for the logic used in our more streamlined implementations.
